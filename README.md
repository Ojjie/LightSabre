## Description

 - A major problem in the Airlines industry is the loss of luggage and property. Almost 35% of the Airlines losses incurred are due to loss of luggage and it is found that this can be avoided by using a decentralized server which has an advantage over conventional databases in that it cannot be hacked into and modified.
 - There are currently a multitude of players involved in this process, who could synchronize by sharing information, which would save airlines costs. This way, the customer and the airline can know where the luggage is at any time.
 - It is also a transparent way to deal with the userâ€™s property so it could even lead to increased business with said airline
 - Our web application will notify the user of the current location of his/her luggage and the path taken by the luggage
 - The server side application includes an option for the airline to mine (add or remove) a block from the blockchain network.
 - Airlines can access the entire blockchain and resolve conflicts within the server side app.
